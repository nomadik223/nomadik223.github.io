        <p>Here we have an excerp from their website, detailing why the owner opened the establishment: "After trying my first Guinness, I found there were other flavors and complexities within each variety of beer that domestic beers didn't offer. As time went on my palate expanded and I leaned more towards darker and malty styles. After graduating in Industrial Design, I moved to Portland Oregon to try and further my design career. I started experimenting and creating my own fine beers from home. After the urging from a friend, I moved to Tacoma and am able to bring my passion to you. Join me at The Copper Door and if you have a favorite beer you'd like me to try or carry, I would love to hear about it. Or just stop by and I will assist you in finding that perfect beer for any occasion or no occasion at all, just relaxation and enjoyment."</p>

        <p>From their home page:
          As the draft beer industry grows, it seems the miles you must travel to taste it all does as well. Here at Rainier Growlers we've come up with a solution by creating a place to bring all that beer together for you.

Of our 40 taps, we have 34 beers and 4 ciders. We also have Root Beer and wine on tap. Glass and insulated growlers are available.
